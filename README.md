[High interest checking accounts](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/#Mega_High-Interest_Nationwide) offer up to a 5% return on your account balance. To qualify for these high returns, you'll typically need to make 10 to 50 debit card transactions per month depending on each bank's requirements. Debbit automates the spending requirement by programatically buying 50 cent Amazon gift cards and paying bills in small increments throughout each month.

Debbit currently supports
- Amazon gift card reloads
- Xfinity bill pay
