If merchant automation is failing, please notify the project maintainer to help get them fixed.

In the failures folder there will be files with timestamps for names. Each timestamp
will have 4 pieces ending in .txt, .png, .html, and a folder ending in coverage.
Open the .png file and make sure it doesnâ€™t have your credit card number or password showing.
Then, email these three files to jakehilborn@gmail.com or open an Issue on GitHub and attach
them there. You can attach one error or all of them, the more errors to inspect the more helpful.

You can try editing the python files directly. Due to how the project is packaged, you probably
won't be able to add any import statements that aren't already included somewhere in the project.
If you get a fix working, or need finer grained control, I encourage you to clone the source code from
https://github.com/jakehilborn/debbit . Please submit a pull request or email any fixes to
jakehilborn@gmail.com so I can release them to the public.
